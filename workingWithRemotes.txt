 * branch            main       -> FETCH_HEAD
fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories

Description:-
This error usually occurs if your local repository and the remote repository donâ€™t share a common history, which can happen if you initialized the repository locally and then tried to link it to a remote repository with an existing history.

To fix this, you can use the --allow-unrelated-histories option when pulling, which will force Git to merge the two separate histories:

COMMAND:-
--->> git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
