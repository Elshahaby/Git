git branch            --> show your all branches in repo
git branch <name>     --> create a branch starting from the current commit
git branch --merged   --> show the branches that allready merged to the current branch (master branch if I stand on master).

====>  after merge, may be delete that branch

git branch -d <branch_name>   --> to delete a branch
-----------------------

====> switching branches : make the HEAD point to that branch 

git switch <branch_name> 
git show HEAD

------------------------

====> Merge branch to master

1. git switch master           --> to go to master branch if you are not.
2. git merge <branch_name>     --> merge the branch you want to the master branch
 
------------------------- 
 
===>  Try to see an exersice for The Three Way Merge
===> Conflict when you merge, if you modify same file in the two merged branches (see an exersice)
