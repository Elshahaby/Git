## Q5: What does the HEAD keyword refer to in git?

####  HEAD refers to the current commit and the current branch that your working Tree is based on. More specifically, it is a pointer to a commit on the currently branch.

- HEAD and Branches:

    - When you run `git switch <branch-name>`, the HEAD pointer moves to point to the latest commit on the specified branch.
    - If you run `git reset --hard <commit>`, HEAD moves to the specified commit.
