## Q4: Write the git commands needed for each of the following scenarios:

<br>

### 1. You want to add all modified files to git staging without specifying each one of them.

```bash
git add *
git add --all
git add .
```

### 2. You have a local repository and you need to add a remote with name deploy and url https://git.heroku.com/example-app.git.

```bash
git remote add deploy "https://git.heroku.com/example-app.git"
```

### 3. You want to get the history of commits in the repository where each commit is represented by one line.

```bash
git log --oneline
```

### 4. You try to make a commit but git asks you to enter your name and email first.
```bash
git config --global user.name "Elshahaby"
git config --global user.email "mo.elsha@gmail.com"
```

### 5. Your work is present on the branch `feature/chat` and you want to merge it with the branch `development`.

- first switch to `development` branch:
```bash
git switch development
```
- Then, merge `feature/chat` branch:
```bash
git merge feature/chat
```

### 6. You realize that you want to add one more file to the last commit without creating a new commit.
```bash
git add <file>
```
- Then, amend the last commit:  
```bash
git commit --amend --no-edit
```
note: The `--no-edit` flag keeps the same commit message, but you can remove this flag if you want to edit the message.
