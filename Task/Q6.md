## Q6: What are the problems with this commit message? list all what you notice.

### Commit message:
Big change to fix everything that was broken

### Commit body:
So I did a lot of stuff in this commit, including fixing bugs, adding new features, and refactoring code. Also cleaned up some old files. Not sure what exactly I did, but everything works now. Hope this doesn't break anything else. If it does, we'll just fix it later. Also, added some random changes to the config file, because why not? Should be good now. Oh, and I made a minor tweak to the UI, but I didn't check it fully. I think it's fine though. Whatever.

- The provided commit message and body contain several issues that go against the principles of Conventional Commits and best practices for writing good commit messages

### 1. Uninformative Subject Line:-

- `problem`: "Big change to fix everything that was broken" is too mysterious.

    - It doesn't specify what was broken or what was changed.
    - The term "big change" is subjective and provides no insight into the nature of the change. instead, you should put a verb at first of commit tell what is the changes that I did, like (add,fix, etc..).

- `Best Practice`: The commit message should be concise and specific, following this structure:
    - type(scope): short description
    - Ex: fix(auth): resolve login erorr on user authentication.


<br> 

### 2. Combines Several Unrelated Changes

- `problem`: The commit combines several unrelated changes—bug fixes, feature additions, code refactoring, and configuration changes—into one commit.

- `Best Practice`: Follow the ***single responsibility*** principle. Each commit should focus on one logical change.
    - Each type of change (fix, feature, refactor) should ideally be in separate commits.

<br>

### 3. Commit Body Lacks Clarity and Detail.

- `Problem`: The body of the commit message is unstructured and informal.
    - Phrases like "did a lot of stuff" and "not sure what exactly I did" show a lack of detail and understanding of the changes.
    - The commit body should describe why the change was made and what  fixes or improves it.

- `Best Practice`: A commit body should be precise, detailing what happened behind the change and listing what specific changes were made. 
    - Example:
    ```
        - Fixed null pointer exception in user login.
        - Added new validation for form fields.
        - Refactored authentication logic for better readability.
    ```

### 4. No Mention of Breaking Changes or Testing

- `Problem`: The commit introduces "random changes to the config file" and "a minor    tweak to the UI" without verifying these changes or mentioning whether they could introduce breaking changes.
    - Commits should clearly state if they introduce breaking changes.
    - The phrase "didn't check it fully" indicates the code wasn't tested properly, which is risky.

- `Best Practice`: If changes are not compatible with last versions, they should be marked with BREAKING CHANGE: in the commit body. Testing should always be confirmed before committing.

<br>

### 5. Informal and Unprofessional Language.

- `Problem`: The language used is overly casual ("because why not?", "I think it's fine", "whatever").
    - Commit messages should be professional and avoid informal language that can cause confusion.

- `Best Practice`: Use clear and formal language that communicates the purpose and reasoning behind the changes.

<br>

### 6.  No Reference to Related Issues or Tasks.

- `Problem`: There is no reference to any issue tracker, bug ID, or feature request, which is useful for context.

- `Best Practice`: Reference relevant tickets or issues in the commit message, such a
```bash
fixes #123
```

<br>

### Summary of Best Practices:-
- Subject line: Be specific and concise (fix(auth): resolve login error on user authentication).
- Scope: Keep each commit focused on one task or area (e.g., bug fixes, refactors, new features).
- Body: Clearly explain what was changed and why, using bullet points if necessary.
- Breaking changes: Use BREAKING CHANGE: if the commit introduces changes that could affect other parts of the project.
- Language: Use formal and professional language.
- Testing: Ensure changes are tested and verified before committing.
- Link to issues: Reference relevant issues, bug reports, or feature requests.

---

Rewriting the original message following these practices might look like:-
```bash
fix(auth): resolve login issue on form validation

- Fixed bug causing form validation errors during user login
- Cleaned up old, unused files from the authentication module
- Refactored code for better readability and maintainability
- Updated config for better logging

BREAKING CHANGE: Minor config updates; ensure testing is done before deploying
Fixes #123
