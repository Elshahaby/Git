#### The statement that is NOT correct is:  "Git is a cloud-based service to store remote repositories."

- Explanation:
    - Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is a tool that can be installed and used locally to manage repositories. Git itself is not a cloud-based service.

    - GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and similar platforms are cloud-based services that host Git repositories and allow developers to collaborate on projects remotely. These platforms provide additional features like issue tracking, pull requests, and team collaboration, but Git as a tool is separate from these services.
