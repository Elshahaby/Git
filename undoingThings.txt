rm -rf .git/             --> delete the repo from my file
git rm --cahed <file>    --> unstage: remove the files from staging area (index) (make the file untracked if it is not commited before in repo).
git restore <file>       --> if I modefy the file in workingTree so the file is red modified 
                             (means that the file is modified in workingTree only, not in staged area or repo)
                             we use that command to restore the last staged and commited version of the modified file.
                             to discard changes in working directory (Tree)
                             Ex: if I write a new line in a file that command restore the file and delete that added line.      
                             workingTree != staging area && workingTree != Repo
git restore --staged <file>  --> to unstage ,changes in --> workingTree == staging area && staging area != Repo
git commit --amend           --> to modify the last commit message
git reset HEAD               --> move the updates from repo to staging area (index)
git reset HEAD --hard        --> move the updates from repo to workingTree dirctly.  Danger(change the physcal files in WT) 
git reset HEAD~<numVerBack>  --> roleBack to old a commit  (move the Head pointer back)
git reset --hard HEAD~1      --> change the physical files at WorkingTree to the files founded in the moved commit in one step.
git reset HEAD@{1}           --> roleForward (fastforward) to a commit   (move the Head pointer forward)
git reset --hard HEAD@{1}
git diff 37ce708..HEAD       --> diff between a commit and the commit that HEAD point at.
git reflog                   --> show the changes of moving the HEAD pointer from commit to another.

-----------------------------------

===> to rollback in old commit and show its files in my working Tree
Ex: lets say that I want to back to the last commit so, we use these commands
git reset HEAD~1     ---> go to last commit and clone the data to staged area (index)
git restore *        ---> restore all files of the last commit that founded in stagged area (index) to my workingTree.
